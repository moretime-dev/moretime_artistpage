        <h2>About me</h2>
        <p>
          Hi, my name is Moretime and I am an Indie Pop/Folk Singer and
          Songwriter from Germany. I write songs about love and life and
          everything in between. In a world, where it seems hard to find a place
          to rest sometimes, I want to provide an escape from everyday stress
          for you. Let me invite you to a dream we can dream together. To a
          plane in between worlds, where we can find together and exist in peace
          and happiness.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you feel weird and out of place in life, looking for somewhere to
          feel like you belong, you've come to the right place! Let me take you
          on a spiritual journey where our minds can be one. Close your eyes,
          listen and leave your body, just for a while. You'll be back,
          refreshed and strong and maybe with some new food for thought. And
          hopefully feeling connected and not alone...
        </p>

      <h2>I Like The Rain</h2>
      <p class="song-desc">
        This song is about not beeing intimidated by the things life throws at
        you and actually enjoying the challenges. Of course it is nice, when the
        sun shines for you, but beeing friends with the rainy clouds is a good
        way to not get overwhelmed. Throw away your umbrella and start trying to
        hug all the raindrops, you'll love the feeling!
      </p>

      <h2>Hair</h2>
      <p class="song-desc">
        Seperating from a love once held close to your heart ain't ever pretty.
        This song is about the strange process of going through this, trying to
        let go, but still hold on a little bit longer, because it just isn't
        easy. We all have our rituals we use to help us pulling through, often
        it feels like one step Forward two steps backward though.
