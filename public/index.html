        <h2>About me</h2>
        <p>
          Hi, my name is Moretime and I am an Indie Pop/Folk Singer and
          Songwriter from Germany. I write songs about love and life and
          everything in between. In a world, where it seems hard to find a place
          to rest sometimes, I want to provide an escape from everyday stress
          for you. Let me invite you to a dream we can dream together. To a
          plane in between worlds, where we can find together and exist in peace
          and happiness.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you feel weird and out of place in life, looking for somewhere to
          feel like you belong, you've come to the right place! Let me take you
          on a spiritual journey where our minds can be one. Close your eyes,
          listen and leave your body, just for a while. You'll be back,
          refreshed and strong and maybe with some new food for thought. And
          hopefully feeling connected and not alone...
        </p>
